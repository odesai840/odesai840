## About Me
I'm a full-time computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I'm interested in a variety of topics including game development, computer graphics, mixed reality, web development, operating systems, artificial intelligence, robotics, computer hardware, and machine learning.

## Current Projects (in order of when I plan to finish them)
* [AdvGameDev](https://github.com/odesai840/AdvGameDev) A fast-paced FPS game made with Unity
* [CapstoneGame](https://github.com/odesai840/CapstoneGame) A first-person horror game made with Unreal Engine 5.
* [SockRT Engine](https://github.com/odesai840/SockRT-Engine) - A ray tracing engine made using Vulkan.
* A complete rewrite of [PlayNest](https://github.com/odesai840/PlayNest) made with React, Node.js, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
* [Sock Engine](https://github.com/odesai840/Sock-Engine) - An upgraded version of [Sock Engine (DX11)](https://github.com/odesai840/Sock-Engine-DX11) made with Rust and WebGPU.
