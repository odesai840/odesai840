## About Me
I'm a full-time computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I'm interested in a variety of topics including game development, graphics programming, web development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

## Currently Working On
* [SockRT Engine](https://github.com/odesai840/SockRT-Engine) - A ray tracing engine made using Vulkan.
* [Sock Engine (WebGPU)](https://github.com/odesai840/Sock-Engine-WebGPU) - An attempt at remaking [Sock Engine (DX11)](https://github.com/odesai840/Sock-Engine-DX11) using Rust and WebGPU.

## Game Dev Projects
My most recent game dev projects can be found on [itch.io](https://sock8416.itch.io/).
